# ⏺️ Service

- A Service exposes your Pod(s) to other pods or external users.
- Since pods are ephemeral (they can die and restart), services provide a stable IP/DNS.
- **Types:**
  - ClusterIP (internal only)
  - NodePort (expose via static port on node)
  - LoadBalancer (cloud-based external IP)
